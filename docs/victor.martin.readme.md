Today we got to know our partners. I started to get familiar with the git repository for common project. Branches, merging, first commits etc. We also discussed about the structure of the project and how are we gonna organise and structure the project.

The weekend after we started coding the project. I implemented the board and piece structure wich is a crucial step for our program to work be able to actually play chess, by the rule but also to let the AI use all the possible rules that are allowed in chess and that could make a difference.

The week after, we talked about how we would organize the project so that there is enough tasks to let everyone work at the same time without causing weird thing with the merging etc. I was given the responability of implementing a test function that would be able to make our AI fight against herself and  check if blunder-ai actually play by the rules, performance, delay for a move etc.

This week, I got very sick and I couldn't work on the project. I reimplemented the structure of the board that was not on gitlab anymore.
